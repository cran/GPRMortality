\title{
Gaussian Process Regression for estimation and projection of child (under-5) mortality rates
}
\description{
 Searching for the latest methods of estimating mortality rates is a major concern. The need to have accurate and valid estimation of under-5 mortality rate led to apply more powerful and reliable methods. The main challenge is how to combine and integrate these different time series and how to produce unified estimates of mortality rates during a specified time span.

GPR is a Bayesian statistical model for estimating child (under-five age group) mortality which its data likelihood could be mortality rates from different data sources such as: Death Registration System, Censuses or surveys. This function produces estimations and uncertainty (95\% or any desirable percentiles) based on sampling and non-sampling errors due to variation in data sources.

The GP model utilizes Bayesian inference to update predicted mortality rates as a posterior in Bayes rule by combining data and a prior probability distribution over parameters in mean, covariance function, and the regression model. This package uses Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) to sample from posterior probability distribution by rstan package in R.

\usage{
GPRMortalityChild( data.mortality , data.mean ,minYear,maxYear,
                   nu,rho_,n.itr=4000,n.warm=3000,verbose=FALSE)
}
\arguments{
  \item{data.mortality}{
a data frame on mortality rates and population. It needs five compulsory basic variables: year, type of data sources, mortality rates and their corresponding population, location (countries and so on ).
}
  \item{data.mean}{
a data frame of data mean, with the same levels (year and location) as data.mortality.
}

  \item{minYear}{
min year will predicted
}
  \item{maxYear}{
max year will predicted
}
 \item{nu}{
the degree of differentiability parameter that is ranged from 0.2 to 2 and it controls the smoothness of samples driven from GP model.
}
  \item{rho_}{
a scale parameter that ranges from 0 to 1 and it defines the amount of correlation between years of data.
}
  \item{n.itr}{
the number of iterations to use for running model in rstan. If not specified, then the default is 4000.
}
\item{n.warm}{
the number of samples for warm-up in MCMC. If not specified, the default is 3000.
}
\item{verbose}{
TRUE or FALSE: flag indicating whether to print intermediate output from Stan on the console, which might be helpful for model debugging.
}
}
\details{
This package intra and extrapolates the mortality rates excluded from different data sources and various demographic models and produces uncertainty.

The algorithm for GPR package was developed in rstan.

The mortality rates will change to per 1000 population.

\value{
a list including two parts:


1.        a matrix of GPR result.

2.        a matrix of completeness bias information of Dearth Registration System by location including coefficients, Standard error of coefficient, and p-value of coefficients whether it can assess that DR system is biased in each location.

3.        a matrix of different data sources variances.

\note{
Each data source must contin at least two data points in the time span between min and max years to be predicted.


min and max years determined the number of years in GPR results.


This package need Rtools to be installed. The version should match with R version.
